  <p align="center" class="gametext" > Just as you decide to keep looting you hear some yell "Put your hands up!" - you fumble for your rifle and a loud bang rings out and you feel something running down your chest... you've been shot. You look up to see the sky closing in on yourself... you are dying. You hear another shout from right behind you telling you to let go of the rifle but you hold strong. He says "last warning", but you didnt let up... you hear a lound bang then nothing. </p>
